      <p> Anna Kliushina (2001) an aspiring oboist based in Finland. She began her musical journey in St. Petersburg at the age of seven as a pianist, inspired by her mother. Three years later, she discovered her true calling with the oboe.

At fourteen, Anna moved to Finland to pursue her musical education. She studied at the Sibelius High School, the East Helsinki Music Institute, and the Helsinki Conservatory, where her principal teachers were oboist Sanna Niemikunnas and pianist Riitta Sipilä. She later continued her studies at the Helsinki Conservatory before being admitted to the Sibelius Academy’s Classical Music Department, where she is currently completing her Master’s degree under the guidance of Kyeong Ham, principal oboist of the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra.

Anna has participated in masterclasses with internationally renowned artists including François Leleux, Alexei Ogrintchouk, Céline Moinet, and Emmanuel Laville. She has also gained extensive orchestral experience, performing with ensembles such as the Helsinki Chamber Orchestra, Hämeenlinna City Orchestra, and the Jyväskylä Symphony Orchestra.

In 2025, Anna graduated with her Bachelor’s degree from the Sibelius Academy and immediately began her Master’s studies. Her goal is to combine a vibrant career as an orchestral musician with a passion for teaching, sharing her artistry with future generations. </p>
